This procedure involves the use of surgical devices to hold fractured bones in place, allowing for proper healing. Bioabsorbable nails are particularly advantageous in cases where the bones are fractured in areas that are difficult to access with traditional metal fixation devices. The use of bioabsorbable nails eliminates the need for additional surgeries to remove the hardware once the bone has healed, thus reducing the overall healthcare burden on patients. Additionally, bioabsorbable materials are biocompatible and degrade safely in the body, minimizing long-term complications related to metal implants.</p> <p>The growing trend of using bioabsorbable nails for internal fixation in fracture treatment is driven by the increasing awareness of their benefits. Surgeons are particularly drawn to these materials for their ability to provide stable fixation while allowing for natural bone healing without the need for follow-up surgeries. Furthermore, bioabsorbable nails are being continuously improved to enhance their mechanical properties, making them suitable for a wider range of fractures, including complex or multi-fragmentary fractures, which were previously treated with metal implants. This development is expected to drive market growth in the coming years.</p> <h2>Osteotomy</h2> <p>Osteotomy is a surgical procedure in which a bone is cut and repositioned to correct deformities or abnormalities. Bioabsorbable bone fixation nails are increasingly being used in osteotomy procedures due to their ability to provide stable fixation while avoiding the long-term complications associated with metal implants. The primary advantage of using bioabsorbable nails in osteotomy is that they can be absorbed by the body over time, negating the need for additional surgery to remove the fixation device once the bone has healed. This not only improves patient comfort but also reduces healthcare costs and the risk of postoperative infections.</p> <p>The demand for bioabsorbable bone fixation nails in osteotomy procedures is expected to rise as the number of patients undergoing these surgeries increases. With an aging population and the growing prevalence of conditions such as osteoarthritis, the need for osteotomy as a treatment option is expected to grow.
